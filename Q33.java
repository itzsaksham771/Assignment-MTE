/*Concept of Sliding Window Technique:
The sliding window technique is a powerful algorithmic approach used to solve
problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings of a given size. Instead of
repeatedly iterating through all possible subarrays/substrings, it maintains a
"window" that slides through the data structure (usually an array or string).
The core idea is to:
1. Define a window: Determine the initial size of the window (fixed or variable).
2. Slide the window: Move the window one element (or a certain number of
elements) at a time across the data structure.
3. Maintain information: Calculate and update the necessary information (sum,
maximum, minimum, count, etc.) within the window as it slides.
Applications in Algorithm Problems:
The sliding window technique is used to solve a variety of problems, including:
● Finding the maximum or minimum sum of a subarray of a fixed size.
● Finding the longest subarray with a sum equal to a given target.
● Finding the longest substring without repeating characters.
● Counting the occurrences of a specific pattern in a string.
● Solving problems involving anagrams.
● Various optimization problems on arrays or strings */
