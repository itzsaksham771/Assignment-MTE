// Concept of Bit Manipulation:
// Bit manipulation involves performing operations directly on the individual bits of
// binary representations of numbers. Instead of working with numbers as abstract
// quantities, you manipulate the 0s and 1s that compose them.
// Advantages in Algorithm Design:
// ● Efficiency: Bitwise operations are often much faster than traditional
// arithmetic operations. They can be executed directly by the CPU.
// ● Space Efficiency: Bit manipulation can allow you to store and process
// information in a very compact form. For example, you can use a single bit to
// represent a boolean flag.

// ● Conciseness: Some algorithms can be expressed more concisely and
// elegantly using bit manipulation.
// ● Solving Specific Problems: Bit manipulation is essential for solving certain
// types of problems, such as those involving:
// ○ Low-level hardware manipulation.
// ○ Error detection and correction.
// ○ Cryptography.
// ○ Compression.
// ○ Optimization problems
