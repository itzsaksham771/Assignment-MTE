// Concept of Histogram Problems:
// A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data. In the context
// of algorithm problems, a histogram is often represented as an array of integers,
// where each integer represents the height of a bar and the width of each bar is
// assumed to be 1.
// Histogram problems involve finding certain properties or solving optimization
// problems related to these bar representations. The key idea is to efficiently
// process the array of heights to extract meaningful information.
// Applications in Algorithm Design:
// Histogram problems appear in various applications and serve as a basis for solving
// other computational challenges:
// 1. Largest Rectangular Area in a Histogram: Finding the largest rectangle that
// can be inscribed within a histogram. This problem has applications in:

// ○ Image Processing: Finding the largest homogeneous region in an image.
// ○ Data Analysis: Finding the maximum area under a curve.
// ○ Resource Allocation: Optimizing the allocation of resources.
// 2. Water Trapping Problem: Calculating the amount of water that can be
// trapped between bars of a histogram after rainfall. This problem is relevant to:
// ○ Civil Engineering: Designing dams and reservoirs.
// ○ Environmental Science: Modeling water retention in landscapes.
// 3. Finding the Nearest Smaller Elements: For each bar in a histogram, finding
// the nearest smaller bar to its left and right. This can be useful in:
// ○ Stock Market Analysis: Finding price support and resistance levels.
// ○ Compiler Design: Analyzing code blocks.
// 4. Maximum Area Submatrix in a Binary Matrix: This problem can be solved
// using histogram techniques. Given a binary matrix, find the largest rectangular
// submatrix containing only 1s.
// 5. Simplified Bar Charts: Many real-world scenarios can be modeled as
// histograms, allowing us to apply histogram problem-solving techniques
